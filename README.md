# QUCS-S Documentation

## 02-2024: Starting fresh...

As of February 2024, we're rewriting the docs since the old docs are woefully out of date, and the Sphinx project won't build correctly. See [issue 554 on the main QUCS source code repository](https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/issues/554).

* Sphinx will still be utilized, although Markdown for most documentation is being considered, as a lower barrier to entry
* ReadTheDocs will still host

At this point nothing else is decided. If you'd like to help, please hop into [issue 554 on the main QUCS source code repository](https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/issues/554) and let's chat! Hopefully soon I'll have a smoother process ironed out and we can start accepting contributions via pull-request, with automatic builds from ReadTheDocs and that sort of thing.

Thanks for your patience!
