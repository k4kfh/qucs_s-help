# Using Equations & Parameters

There are many cases in circuit simulation where you may wish to parameterize device properties in your circuit for easy changes, or graph mathematical functions of your simulation data, rather than raw voltages and currents. Qucs-S has various parameter and equation features to support these use cases, depending on which [simulation backend](/overview/choosing-a-sim-backend) you are using.

See the sub-pages below for information on using your particular backend's features.
