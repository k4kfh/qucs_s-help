Welcome to the Qucs-S Documentation!
==========================================

Qucs-S is a circuit simulation program, forked from the original `Qucs circuit simulator. <https://qucs.sourceforge.net/>`_

Qucs-S aims to provide a convenient, unified GUI around various free circuit simulation kernels (such as ngspice, Xyce, Qucsator, etc). It merges the power of SPICE with the simplicity of the Qucs GUI.
