# Installing QUCS-S

## Installing on Windows

For each release, an executable installer (not a ``.msi`` package) is available, as well as a ``.zip`` file containing a portable installation. [Visit the Releases page on GitHub.](https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/releases)

## Installing on OSX

OSX installation ``.dmg``'s are available [with each Release on GitHub.](https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/releases)

## Installing on Linux

For Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and OpenSUSE, [packages are available on the OpenSUSE Build Service.](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Ara3xdh&package=qucs-s) Simply follow the installation instructions on the build service page.

> **Note: If you install on Ubuntu or Debian using the packages above, the ``ngspice`` simulator is installed automatically.** If you wish to use any of the other supported simulation backends, you will need to install them separately._

For all other distributions, an AppImage file is available. [Get the latest release from GitHub.](https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs_s/releases)

Once you have installed QUCS-S, you will likely need to install simulation backends separately. This is covered in the next chapter.
