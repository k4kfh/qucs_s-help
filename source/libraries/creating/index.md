# Creating Libraries

There are two methods to create Libraries in QUCS-S:

1. [**Create a Library Manually, with fully customizable circuitry and symbology.**](/libraries/creating/manual-library-creation) This is the most common method, since it gives you the most power to customize the Library components.
2. [**Create a Library by Importing SPICE Discrete Component Models (``.MODEL`` data), using the "Convert Data Files" tool (QucsConv).**](/libraries/creating/qucsconv) This is most commonly used to import model libraries from other tools, such as LTSpice or Micro-Cap.
